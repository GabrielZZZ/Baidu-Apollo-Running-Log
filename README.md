# Baidu-Apollo-Running-Log

Hello. This is a repository that records my "daily" program running logs. I will keep updating it as long as I am still doing my PhD project. If you are also working on the Baidu's Apollo open software program and LGSVL simulator, I hope some contents here could help you.

You are also welcomed to contact me if you have any ideas about the challenges I am facing, or vice versa.:smiley:
