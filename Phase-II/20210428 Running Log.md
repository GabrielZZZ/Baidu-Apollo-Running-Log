## Progress
The current progress is about how to customize the scenario using SVL simulator. After several days learning, I have grasped the basic use of the python API in the simulator. The working focus now is on the Visual Editor of SVL simulator.

## Problems
It seems that there are some bugs with Visual Editor, [issues](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues/1370), but so far I have not encountered any specific ones.
* There is one problem actually that how to measure the distance of car driving. See [here](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues/1393)
