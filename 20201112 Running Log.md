# Challenges
- Cannot get the perception and traffic light module work correctly

# Progress
- Figure out the usage of the button "sim_control" in Apollo Dreamview
  - There is no obstacls inside the scene, you need to adding it manually (including traffic lights)
  - Also the speed is extremely slow
- Figure out the usage of demo given by Apollo project
  - It turns off the perception and traffic light module
  - If I want to test the perception module, I have to go to LGSVL Simulator (for now)
