# Progress
- Successfully extracted .pcd files by using `record_parse_save.py` but in **Apollo-5.0**
  - The team said in the issue page that they just fixed this problem in Apollo 6.0 (master) but I haven't tested it;
  - I think the results should be the same since there would be just configuration problem;
  - **I will test it again by using Apollo master after I finish the first replication stage**
