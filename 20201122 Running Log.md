- Try to read point cloud files and print it using my own python code
- Try to find the function that process point cloud data in Apollo system by go through the source code of the system
  - I think I have found the exact function that the old research has used two years ago:`Fusion Obstacle Visualization Tool`, since the functionality that it provides is very similar to the one mentioned in the paper ("LOP Software" in **Metamorphic Testing of Driverless Cars**):
    - "You see results such as:
      - A pop-up window showing the perception result with the point cloud, frame-by-frame
      - The raw point cloud shown in grey
      - Bounding boxes (with red arrows that indicate the headings) that have detected:
      - Cars (green)
      - Pedestrians (pink)
      - Cyclists (blue)
      - Unknown elements (purple)"
