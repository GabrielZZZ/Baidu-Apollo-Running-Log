## Challenges
- Still cannot solve the problem of the perception and traffic light module accidently switch on and off without control
  - have already submit this problem to the GitHub community of LGSVL; currently still exchanging information
- The moduler testing work fine and have no bugs (it based on the assumption that perception message is 100% correct). It is ready to be tested. However, it cannot be used to test the perception module anymore. **It can be used to test other modules, such as planning and routing modules**

## progress
- continue communicating with the official LGSVL development team on GitHub 

## Notes
- Based on the present situation, it may be hard to replicate the existing research since it was studying the perception module of the Apollo system.
- **OR consider performing the experiment without LGSVL Simulator since Apollo 6th has fully supported RTX 2080.**
